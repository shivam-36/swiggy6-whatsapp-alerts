# swiggy6-whatsapp-alerts
Using this project you can send Whatsapp notifications to your friends whenever a six is hit in an ongoing IPL match.
All you need to do is, get the corresponding match id from this link http://mapps.cricbuzz.com/cbzios/match/livematches 
and replace this in the file criccApp.py 

The coupon code SWIGGY6 is valid for 6 minutes from the last six hit. This script can send a Whatsapp message to a particular contact or a broadcast list or a group.

Requirements:
Browser WebDriver (I have used chrome, while you can use any browser but need to download the corresponding webdriver) https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
